Mixology, an artistry that has bewitched my senses, captivates me with its symphony of flavors and creativity. The meticulous craftsmanship behind each libation, the harmonious dance of spirits, and the alchemical fusion of ingredientsâ€”this is why I am enamored by mixology. Hence, taking this hackathon as an excuse, I tried to create this app, a digital sanctuary meticulously crafted to preserve the essence of every extraordinary libation I encounter.
